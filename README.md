# Windows Forms App with C++ and .NET Framework
This is a project template made for [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). This template can be used to make GUI Applications for Windows using [Windows Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8) user interface. It can be compiled using [Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/overview-of-windows-programming-in-cpp?view=msvc-160) and [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework). Applications built like this runs using Microsoft's [common language runtime (CLR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) library.

The Latest version of Visual Studio as of writing this, contains Windows Forms App template for [Visual C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/) by default. The Visual C++ template for the same was removed for some reason. Thats why I made this template for people who can't figure out how to start making a Windows Forms App using C++.

## Prerequisites:
Visual Studios should be installed along with the following workloads:
* Desktop development with C++
* .NET desktop development

## How to add this template to Visual Studio:
To add this template to Visual Studios, follow the steps below:
* [Click here to Download the template](https://github.com/HiDe-Techno-Tips/Windows-Forms-App-with-C-Plus-Plus/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
* Extract the downloaded zip file using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0).
* Copy the folder contained inside the zip file. Make sure the folder that you copied contains the files that you see in this repository.
* Open Explorer in Windows and open your Documents folder from Libraries, Quick access or the side pane. Alternately you can go to `C:\Users\<your username here>\Documents` by entering it in the path box of Windows Explorer. Remember to replace `<your username here>` without the `<>`.
* Here you will find a folder named `Visual Studio <the version year>`, where `<the version year>` is replaced by a year, most likely `2019` depending on your installed version.
* In that folder, go to `Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C++` and paste the folder that you copied.

After doing this, this template will appear alongside other default templates when you click `Create a new Project` in Visual Studio as seen in the sreenshot below:
